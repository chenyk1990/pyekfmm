REMEMBER:
1. The files in this folder (demo/data) need to be small.
If you are not sure wether it is small and want to upload it to this folder, please let me (chenyk2016@gmail.com) know first.

2. For larger files, we have a separate repository. 

3. The source package is deemed to be small for downloading and installation purposes.
